description: '"8K-10K Schedule 1: 30 to 42 Miles (48-67 km) per Week" from "Faster
  Road Racing: 5K to Half Marathon" by Pete D. Pfitzinger and Philip Latter. "This
  schedule is for runners who have been training 25 to 35 miles per week. If you have
  been running fewer than 25 miles per week, you should follow the base-training schedule
  in chapter 8 for building up to 30 miles per week before attempting this schedule.
  The schedule starts at 30 miles per week and gradually builds up to 42 miles with
  three weeks to go before your goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit
  and refreshed for race day."'
