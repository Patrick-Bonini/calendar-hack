description: '"8K-10K Schedule 2: 38 to 57 Miles (61-92 km) per Week" from "Faster
  Road Racing: 5K to Half Marathon" by Pete D. Pfitzinger and Philip Latter. "This
  schedule is for runners who have been training 40 to 50 miles per week. If you have
  been running fewer than 40 miles per week, follow the base-training schedule in
  chapter 8 for building up to 45 miles per week before attempting this schedule.
  This schedule starts at 45 miles per week and gradually builds up to 57 miles with
  three weeks to go before your goal race. The training then tapers so you are fit
  and refreshed for race day."'
